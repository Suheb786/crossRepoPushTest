                '''If you have a social security number (SSN), enter it here. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5 from a Social Security Administration (SSA) office or online at www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf PDF. If you are in the United States, you can call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. Complete Form SS-5 and return it to the SSA.
If you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, you can get an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It usually takes 4â€“6 weeks to get an ITIN. To claim certain treaty benefits, you must complete line 5 by submitting an SSN or ITIN, or line 6 by providing a foreign tax identification number (foreign TIN).

An ITIN is for tax use only. It does not entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigration status under U.S. law.

A partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States will likely be allocated effectively connected taxable income. The partner is required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and must have a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN).

You must provide an SSN or TIN if you are:

Claiming an exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain annuities received under qualified plans, or
Submitting the form to a partnership that conducts a trade or business in the United States.
